Daniel Londono: I am a sofware engineer with about 10 years of experience in different programming languages. I am one of those who does not focus on learning deep a language, but instead to understand the concepts and the rational of software development, so I can become programming language agnostic. Maybe this is just an excuse of my lazy mind that can hardly remember things :)

# algorithms
This is a project to try different implementations for some of the common algorithmic problems

# Most of the implementation is done in C++, however I keep track of some implementation in Python
